 An unexpected error ( SIG$SEGV ) has occurred...  ANSYS internal data   
 has been corrupted.  ANSYS is unable to recover and will terminate.     
 Previously saved files are unaffected.  Please send the data leading    
 to this operation to your technical support provider, as this will      
 allow ANSYS, Inc to improve the program.

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.188   TIME= 13:13:54
 The mesh of area 1 contains PLANE182 triangles, which are much too      
 stiff in bending.  Use quadratic (6- or 8-node) elements if possible.   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.156   TIME= 13:25:25
 Both solid model and finite element model boundary conditions have been 
 applied to this model.  As solid loads are transferred to the nodes or  
 elements, they can overwrite directly applied loads.                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.828   TIME= 13:25:26
 Pivoting has been activated for the Sparse Matrix solver.  The memory   
 required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that event, use   
 the BCSOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or memory size      
 used by the Sparse Matrix solver.
